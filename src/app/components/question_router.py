1. **Image Creation**: Commands to create or generate visual content, with "create", "generate", "make", "draw", or similar (e.g., "genrate", "creat") AND "image", "picture", "photo", or "art". Examples: "Generate an image of a sunset", "Create a picture of a church", "Make photo of Jesus", "Genrate art of a tree".
2. **Appointment**: Requests to manage appointments, meetings, or sessions, with "book", "schedule", "accept", "show", "delete", "read", "reserve", or similar (e.g., "shedule", "apointment") AND "appointment", "meeting", or "session". Also includes shorthand like "appt tomorrow". Examples: "Book a meeting tomorrow", "Show session details", "Delete apointment", "Can you reserve a spot for 12th May?", "appt for today".
3. **Prayer or Counselling**: Requests for spiritual or emotional support, with "pray", "prayer", "counsel", "counselling", "advice", "guidance", "talk", or similar (e.g., "preyer", "councelling"). Also includes emotional pleas like "help my soul". Examples: "Pray for my family", "I need counselling", "Give spiritual guidance", "Help me, pray now", "Talk to a pastor".
4. **Watch Sermon**: Commands to access sermons, with "watch", "show", "play", "get", "view", "stream", or typos (e.g., "paly", "shwo", "sarmon") AND "sermon", "preaching", "ministration", "message", "service", or "homily". Includes "sermon of [time]", "latest [term]", or shorthand like "sermon today". Examples: "Watch a sermon", "Play The Two Way Dance sermon", "Get yesterday’s sermon", "Show latest preaching", "Stream service now".
5. **None**: Input that is:
   - A command not matching above (e.g., "Tell a joke").
   - Too vague or single words without clear intent (e.g., "image", "appointment").
   - Questions, unless clearly implying a command (e.g., "Can you book a meeting?" → 'Appointment'). Examples: "What’s the weather?", "Tell a story", "Sermon", "Can you dance?".

**Rules**:
- Choose the first matching category in order (e.g., "Pray and book appointment" → 'Prayer or Counselling').
- Handle typos and phonetic errors (e.g., "genrate" → "generate", "appoitnment" → "appointment", "sarmon" → "sermon", "prrayer" → "prayer").
- Interpret shorthand or vague commands (e.g., "appt tomorrow" → 'Appointment', "prayer" → 'Prayer or Counselling' if implying a request).
- Allow questions implying commands to route to the relevant category (e.g., "Can you pray for me?" → 'Prayer or Counselling').
- For ambiguous inputs with "sermon" and no question words (e.g., "get sermon"), default to 'Watch Sermon'.
- Ignore filler words (e.g., "um", "please") and repetition (e.g., "pray pray").
- Output only one of: 'Image Creation', 'Appointment', 'Prayer or Counselling', 'Watch Sermon', 'None'."""
